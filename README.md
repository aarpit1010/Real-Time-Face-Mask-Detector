<h1 align="center">Real-Time-Face-Mask-Detector</h1>

The inspiration for this was taken from Adrian Rosebrock (PyImageSearch). This project aims to detect 
whether a person is wearing a mask or not. It is implemented in Python using Keras and OpenCV. 

## Motivation
In the COVID-19 crisis wearing masks is absolutely necessary for public health and controlling the spread of the pandemic. 
So, what if we could have a system that could monitor and supervise people complying with the safety measures like wearing of the masks.
Currently, there is no efficient face mask detection applications available for ensuring public safety. 

## :warning: Framework(s) used

- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
- [Keras](https://keras.io/)

## :file_folder: Dataset
There are a few different datasets available for this project on the internet, I have used the one from [Prajna](https://github.com/prajnasb).
Here is the google drive link for the dataset - [Click to Download](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PruHnSocJppeW24rzrXNb8G0IWe-r9ro?usp=sharing).

## :handshake: Contribution Guidelines

- A number of issues will be created for improving the model and for performing various tasks related to the project on the the 
[Real-Time-Face-Mask-Detector](https://github.com/GeekHaven/Real-Time-Face-Mask-Detector/issues) repository.
 - Descriptive codes (with appropriate comments) written in PEP - 8 format are encouraged.
 - Before starting your work on an issue, do comment something of the sort "I want to work on this".
But remember, **not all PRs would be accepted for an issue**.
 - Create a new branch while working whenever possible.
 - It is a request to **not make the changes in the given code file**, rather name the file for each issue as  `<ISSUE No._YOUR-ROLL-NO>`. 
If you are submitting the code in `IPYNB` format, make sure you link **Google Colab** so it can run on it easily.
